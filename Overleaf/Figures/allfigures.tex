\textit{Notes.} Each horizontal bar shows the composition of extracted cause spans (Panel~A) or effect spans (Panel~B) across the five macro categories for a given technology, pooled over all firms and quarters. Technologies are sorted by the share of the dominant category. The dashed line marks 80\%. See Table~\ref{tab:macro-categories} for macro-category definitions and Section~III.B for discussion.

\begin{flushleft}\footnotesize
\textit{Notes.} Each panel plots the number of unique firms with at least one
causal snippet about the indicated technology in a given quarter. Panel~A shows
platform technologies with a sustained ramp in discussion intensity. Panel~B
shows feature technologies with spike-and-decline patterns. Panel~C shows
policy-driven technologies with stop-go waves; dotted vertical lines mark the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009), the Paris Agreement and solar ITC
extension (2015), solar tariffs (2018), and the Inflation Reduction Act (2022).
Sample: 2002:Q1--2024:Q4. See Section~III.C for discussion.

\begin{flushleft}\footnotesize
\textit{Notes.} This figure plots the average cross-category correlation between a firm's initial cause (effect) shares and its current shares at each tenure quarter, for the 1,933 firm--technology pairs observed in at least two quarters.  For each tenure $\tau$, we compute the Pearson correlation between initial and current shares separately for each of the five macro categories and average across categories.  Blue solid line: cause shares.  Red dashed line: effect shares.  Gray bars (right axis): number of observations at each tenure quarter.  See Section~IV.C for discussion.
