\caption{Macro Categories for Technology-Adoption Causes and Effects}
\label{tab:macro-categories}
\begin{flushleft}\footnotesize
\textit{Notes.} This table reports the distribution of extracted causal-language spans across macro categories.
The unit of observation is an upstream \emph{cause} span (Panel A) or a downstream \emph{effect} span (Panel B)
from an extracted causal triple after taxonomy assignment and macro-category mapping. Shares are computed as the
number of assigned spans in a macro category divided by the total number of spans on the same side (causes or
effects), pooled across all technologies, firms, and quarters.
