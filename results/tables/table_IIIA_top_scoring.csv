3d printing,"At record, as an example, we showed the 3D-printed cylinder produced for Wärtsilä, the global leader in innovative technologies and lifecycle solutions in the marine and energy markets. On its journey to enable carbon-neutral shipping and energy production, Wärtsilä explored innovative design to optimize the cooling performance of the cylinder head achieving a 60% weight reduction compared to the original design. This new design also allows the integration of up to 10 subsystems into the final component, reducing assembly complexity and improving cooling performance. Previously, the design complexity and far side of this innovative design made it impossible to 3D-printed part using conventional large-scale AM technology. However, by combining nTop's design software with Materialise's metrics and extra build processor based on implicit modeling, it has become possible to 3D printer part. We will now start onboarding customers in an early access program with Nikon SLM Solutions being the first early access partner in this program.

Fracking,"I do want to point out that our US Land segment operates in a drilling market that is highly correlated with spot oil and gas price levels and movement. At only around 18% of last year's revenues, US Land provides us with a meaningful exposure to this attractive but highly volatile market, but not so much that it raises business risk unduly for us. The skills and experience we gained there allows us to dividend out those capabilities to other attractive and less volatile land drilling markets overseas. With technology advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, unconventional shale gas drilling, coupled with a slowly recovering economy and a warm winter, has led to extremely low natural gas prices in the US. This, in turn, has led to a noticeable decline in gas-directed drilling, though many operators have shifted their focus to oil-directed and gas-liquids-directed drilling, as oil prices have remained high. It is still early days, but the net effect on overall drilling activity in the continental US to this point has been to slow its rate of growth, such as it has leveled off. We continue to monitor the US onshore drilling market for changes, and have both the experience of managing activity downward during a market contraction, which we last saw in 2009, as well as managing rapid growth in a market upswing, such as we saw most recently in 2010 and '11.",technology advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques,RigNet Inc,94522,"Please turn to Slide 5 of the presentation for the Q2 2022 performance summary.

So that's not -- that doesn't take away from that growth rate projection. And really, what's driving that is just the acceptance and the wider penetration of full Driver Assist systems in the vehicle space. So in other words, when there's already a camera on the car that's doing the lane departure warning or forward crash, obviously, they don't necessarily need to have a second camera to do lighting control. And so from an economic standpoint, the OEMs are looking for the cheapest way to accomplish that feature set, and often times, it's going to be more advantageous for them to add that type of content and software to an existing hardware module, and so that's what's causing most of the headwind. Now what we've been successful at over the last few years, and this has been the case for, really, the last 5, 6 years since Driver Assist has started to roll out in higher volumes.
